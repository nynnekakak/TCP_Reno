# Results Directory

This directory contains trace files and simulation results generated by the TCP Reno simulation.

## Generated Files

After running the simulation, you will find the following files:

### Trace Files
- `cwnd-trace.dat` - Congestion window size over time
- `rtt-trace.dat` - Round-trip time measurements
- `throughput-trace.dat` - Throughput measurements over time

### PCAP Files
- `reno-sim-*.pcap` - Packet capture files for each network interface
- These can be analyzed with Wireshark or other network analysis tools

## Analysis

These files can be imported into TraceMetrics or analyzed with various tools:

1. **TraceMetrics**: Import the .dat files directly
2. **Gnuplot**: Use the trace data to create performance graphs
3. **Wireshark**: Open .pcap files for detailed packet analysis
4. **Python/MATLAB**: Parse the data files for custom analysis

## File Formats

### Trace Data Format
- Time values are in seconds
- Throughput is measured in Mbps
- RTT values are in milliseconds
- Congestion window values are in bytes
